## Takeaways

- in Javascript, is `[]` an array? Not strictly, in terms of data structures:
  * the data in Javascript lists is not contiguous
  * the data does not have to be homogeneous
  * lists in Javascript do not have capacities
  * has a dynamic size
- Rust's arrays _are_ arrays in this sense. They:
  * have a fixed capacity
  * allocate items contiguously in memory
  * have homogeneous types for their values
