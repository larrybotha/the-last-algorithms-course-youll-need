## Takeaways


## Notes

- arrays represent contiguous memory space, which is distinct from a list
- when performing array access for homogenous arrays, by providing an index to
    the computer you're telling the computer:
  * for this contiguous memory space, where each item is allocated a chunk of
      memory of N bytes (e.g. we have 32bit int)
  * multiply the value of the memory allocation by the index I've given you
  * return the value at that location in memory
